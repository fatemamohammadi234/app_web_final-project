            <p class="me">"Photography means love; "Photography means life" you must have lived with photography with all your heart to be able to deeply understand the meaning of this sentence!
                We all like to take pictures with digital cameras or mobile phones, which are very popular today. Undoubtedly, photography gives us a lot of pleasure. It can be said that photography gives us another perspective to live. Take your camera one day and go to the heart of nature. Take pictures from far away and different scenes of nature. Record the most beautiful moments with your camera lens and watch them later! What do you think could be more enjoyable than these moments?!
                Welcome to my photography website.
                 I started learning the art of photography at the age of 15.
                Now I am a professional photographer who travels to different countries and regions and takes extremely beautiful and unique photos.
                I traveled to New York, England, Berlin, New Zealand, Morocco, Chile, Myanmar, Russia, Peru and Canada and took many photos and also won many awards and certificates, and the last time from the organization (Shining a light) which It is an American organization, I was honored.
                Some of my photos are included in this website, and I will also teach you how to become a professional photographer and how to choose the best camera to start your journey.
